Take the sum of $14$ and $13$, and it's $27$ modulo $30$, $27\notin G_1$ thus, $G_1$ is not a subgroup of $G$.
\subsection{} %b
We can check some necessary properties a subgroup must follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All elements of $G_2$ are also in $G$, $G_2\in G$
    \item $\exists e$ such that $\forall g\in G_2,g+e=e+g=g$. There $e=0$.
    \item $0+0\equiv 0\pmod{30}$, thus, $g^{-1}=0$ when $g=0$. All the other non-zero elements $\in G_2$ can be written as the form $2k,k\in[1,14],k\in\mathbb{N}$. Assume $g=2k$, then there must exists an element $h=2(15-k)\in G_2$ such that $g+k\equiv 0\pmod{30}$. Thus, every element in $G_2$ has an inverse element.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{} %c
Take the sum of $1$ and $29$, and it's $0$ modulo $30$, $0\notin G_3$ thus, $G_3$ is not a subgroup of $G$.

\subsection*{(i)}
\begin{proof}
Since $H$ is not empty, we can choose $x,y\in G$.

By the closedness of inverse, the inverse of $x$ exists and belongs to the $H$, let $y=x^{-1}$.

By the closedness of $*$, $x*x^{-1}=e\in H$, where $e$ is the identity element of $H$. Thus, the identity of $H$ exists.

Since $H$ is closed under products, and inverse for each element exists, and the identity for $H$ exists. It's a group and $H\subset G$, so $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
\end{proof}
\subsection*{(ii)}
For simplicity, I denote the determinant of a n by n matrix $A$ as $|A|$.

Since the determinant of an identity matrix $I_n$ is $1$, $SL_n(\mathbb{R})\ne \emptyset$.

For any matrices $a,b\in SL_n(\mathbb{R})$, suppose $c=ab$, then $c$ must be a real matrix (all entries are real), also, $|c|=|a||b|=1*1=1$, the determinant of $c$ is also $1$. Thus, $c\in SL_n(\mathbb{R})$. Here proves the closedness of matrix multiplication.

\noindent \textbf{Claim 1: } Real $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $|A|\ne0$
\begin{proof}
Suppose $A$ is invertible, then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB=I$. $|I|=|A||B|=1$, $|A|$ can't be zero. 

Assume $|A|\ne 0$, then $B=\frac{1}{|A|}\mathrm{adj}(A)$ (B is also a real $n\times n$ matrix) satisfies $AB=BA=I$ where $\mathrm{adj}(A)$ is the classical adjoint matrix of A and I is the identity matrix.

Thus, $|A|\ne 0$ is necessary and sufficient.
\end{proof}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}

By claim 1, every element in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ has its inverse due to their non-zero determinant. Suppose A is any matrix in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$, and its inverse is $A^{-1}$, then $AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I,|A||A^{-1}|=|I|=1$, thus, $|A^{-1}|=1$.

Hence, the inverse of A, i.e., $A^{-1}$ is also in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$. Here the closedness of inverse is proved. By the subgroup criterion proved in 2(i), $\mathrm{SL}_n({\mathbb{R}})$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n({\mathbb{R}})$.

\subsection{} %a
\begin{proof}
Let's call the two sets $A$ and $B$. $A=\{1,2,\dots,n\},B=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. And $A$ is mapped to $B$.

Since the map is bijective, for $1$ in $A$, there are $n$ choices to be mapped, after $1$ is mapped, $2$ in $A$ has $n-1$ choices to be mapped, and so on.

Thus, there are $n(n-1)(n-1)\dots1=n!$ types of bijection, i.e., the order of $S_n$ is $n!$.
% I still need to show that S is a group!!!
\end{proof}
\subsection{} %b
\subsection{} %c
The identity element in the group for matrices multiplication is the identity matrix $I_{2\times2}$.

For $a$, $a=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1\\1 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\big)$,$a^2=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & 0\\0 & -1\end{smallmatrix}\big)$,$a^3=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1\\-1 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\big)$,$a^4=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{smallmatrix}\big)=I_{2\times2}$. Thus, $o(a)=4$. For $b$, $b=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1\\-1 & -1\end{smallmatrix}\big)$, $b^2=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & -1\\1 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\big)$,$b^3=\big(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{smallmatrix}\big)=I_{2\times2}$, thus, $o(b)=3$.

\begin{theorem} \textbf{Bézout's identity}

Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z},ab\ne0$

$d=\gcd{(a,b)}$ be the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. 

Then $\exists x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $ax+by=d$. Also, $d$ is the smallest positive integer combination of $a$ and $b$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

Given any two non-zero integer $a,b$, Let set $S=\{ax+by:x,y\in\mathbb{Z}\land ax+by>0\}$

It's trivial that $S$ is not an empty set (For example, $a>0,x=1,y=0$ or $a<0,x=1,y=0$, $ax+by\in S$, thus, $S$ is not an empty set). Since all elements in $S$ are positive integers, by well ordering principle, $S$ contains a least element $d$. And write it as the form $d=au+bv$, where $u$ and $v$ are integers.

Consider $a$'s euclidean division: $a=qd+r, q\in\mathbb{Z}, 0\le r < d$, we have:
\[r=a-qd=a-q(au+bv)=a(1-qu)-bqv\]
Because both $1-qu$ and $qv$ are integers, $r\in S\cup \{0\}$ (because $0\le r < d$). Also, $d$ is the least element in $S$, this implies that $r$ is not belonging to $S$, it must be $0$. Thus, $d|a$. Similarily, $d|b$.

Consider arbitrary common divisor $c$ of $a,b$, $\exists s,t$ such that $a=cs,b=ct$. So, $d=au+bv=c(us+vt)$, because $us+vt\in \mathbb{Z}$, we know $c|d\land c\le d$.

Since $d$ is greater than all divisors, $d=\gcd{(a,b)}$, it's also the least element in $S$ by previous definition.
\end{proof}

\noindent \textbf{Claim 2: } If x is the generator of cyclic group $H$, then the order of $H$ is the same as $x$ (If one side of this equality is infinite, so is the other).
\begin{proof}
Let $|x|=n$ and first consider the case when $n<\infty$. The elements $1,x,x^2,\dots,x^{n-1}$ are distinct since if $x^a=x^b,0\le a<b<n$ then $x^{b-a}=1$, which contradict $n$ being the smallest positive power give the identity. Also, we can write any integer power $t$ as the form $t=ns+r,0\le r<n$. Hence, $x^t=x^{ns+r}=(x^n)^sx^r=x^r\in\{1,x,\dots,x^{n-1}\}$, $x$ can generate all elements in $H$.

Suppose $|x|=\infty$ so no power of $x$ is the identity, If $x^a=x^b$ for some $a$ and $b$, with $a<b$, then $x^{b-a}=1$ induced a contradiction. Distinct power of $x$ are distinct elements of $|H|$, so $|H|=\infty$ is true.
\end{proof}

\noindent \textbf{Claim 3: } Let G be an arbitrary group, $x\in G$ and let $m,n\i,n\mathbb{Z}$. If $x^n = 1$ and $x^m = 1$, then $x^d = 1$, where $d=(m,n)$ In particular, if $x^m = 1$ for some $m\in\mathbb{Z}$, then $|x|$ divides $m$.
\begin{proof}
By Theorem 1 there exists integers $a$ and $b$ such that $d=an+bm,d=(m,n)$. Thus, $x^d=x^{an+bm}=(x^n)^a(x^m)^b=1$, this proves the first assertion.

If $x^m=1$, let $n=|x|$. If $m=0$, $n|m$ is trivially true. Assume $m$ is not zero, by preceeding result, $x^d=1,d=(m,n)$. Since $0< d\le n$ and $n$ is the smallest positive power of $x$ which gives the identity, we must have $d=n$, that is $n|m$ as the claim said.
\end{proof}
\noindent \textbf{Claim 4:} Let $G$ be a group, let $x\in G$ and let $a\in\mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$, if $o(x)=n<\infty$, then $o(x^a)=\frac{n}{(n,a)}$. 

\noindent \textbf{Claim 5:} Let $H=<x>$. Assume $o(x)=n<\infty$. Then $H=<x^a>$ if and only if $(a,n)=1$.

\subsection{} %c
Since elements in the abelian group $(G,*)$ are commutative, i.e., for any $a,b\in G$, we have $a*b=b*a$.

Let's choose one arbitrariry elements $g$, consider the subgroup as $B=\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m\}$. Then $gB=\{g*a_1,g*a_2,\dots,g*a_m\}$, and $Bg=\{a_1*g,a_2*g,\dots,a_m*g\}$. since $g*a_i=a_i*g$ for all $i$, we have $gB=Bg$.

Hence, by the definition, every subgroup of an abelian group is normal.
